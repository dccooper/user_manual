## Welcome to My Guide on Collaborating with Dave

Inspired by this post on [a new document for the modern manager](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/) I thought putitng this together would be helpful for both me and you. For me, it allows me to self relfect, be critical and be honest with myself about how I work. For you, I hope this document is helpful by being explicit about how I think and work. A lot of things at work tend to go unspoken and I think it would be better if people are more clear, honest and upfront - rather than let people try to puzzle things out on their own. 

> The goal of a user guide is to set blindingly clear expectations on how to collaborate without extra second guessing.

My hope is that this will help us get to know each other faster, work better and have a stronger relationship. I'm also commited to keeping this a living document that I'll update based on feedback from you and others as to how I can be more effective.

### Communication

### Reporting

### One-on-ones

### Feedback
#### From you to me
If I respect you as a colleague - and you respect me - please be frank and honest with me. I'm an adult and I'm not going to get upset of you point out I did something wrong or that upset you. I want to know these things. How else will I find out I goofed if someone doesn't point it out to me?! 
While I may not always agree with your point of view, I am commited to hearing you out and disscussing it.
