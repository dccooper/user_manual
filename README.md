## Welcome to My Guide on Collaborating with Dave

Inspired by this post on [a new document for the modern manager](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/) I thought putitng this together would be helpful for both me and you. For me, it allows me to self relfect, be critical and be honest with myself about how I work. For you, I hope this document is helpful by being explicit about how I think and work. A lot of things between professional colleagues tend to go unspoken and I think it would be better if people are more clear, honest and upfront - rather than let people try to puzzle things out on their own. 

> The goal of a user guide is to set blindingly clear expectations on how to collaborate without extra second guessing.

My hope is that this will help us get to know each other faster, work better and have a stronger relationship. I also hope I can live up to what I write here. I'm human, I goof up and don't always hit the mark. But part of this is holding myself to a public standard of behavior. Finally, I'm also commited to keeping this a living document that I'll update based on feedback from you and others as to how I can be more effective.

### Communication

### Reporting

### One-on-ones
I really like one-on-ones. I think it's the [most important thing](https://www.manager-tools.com/.../the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1) I can do with you as a manager. 

### Feedback
#### From you to me
If I respect you as a colleague - and you respect me - please be frank and honest with me. I'm an adult and I'm not going to get upset of you point out I did something wrong or that upset you. I want to know these things. How else will I find out I goofed if someone doesn't point it out to me?! 
While I may not always agree with your point of view, I am commited to hearing you out and disscussing it.

#### From me to you

You can find out more about how I try to give feedback and why [here](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/giving-effective-feedback
).

If I don't provide you feedback this way - or the way I'm doing it isn't helpful to you - please call me out on it. (See Above)


### Professional Development
I want you to succeed and so I want to know what you want to do and where you want to go in your career. I've gotten where I have because people have helped me, so it's only right to return the favor. 

### Personal Space
If someone is making you uncomfortable at work, please let me know. Work is not a place where anyone should feel harrassed, discriminated against, or otherwise uncomfortable. (I've been there myself. Pounding Tums like candy before you walk in the door isn't fun.) 

And if that person is somehow me, **PLEASE PLEASE** let me know - it is certainly not my intention to amke anyone feel uncomfortable. So if I have goofed up, I need to fix my behavior and make it right with you. (And if you don't feel comfortable doing that, I respect that too.)
