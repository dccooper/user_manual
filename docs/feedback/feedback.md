Feedback
From you to me
If I respect you as a colleague - and you respect me - please be frank and honest with me. I’m an adult and I’m not going to get upset of you point out I did something wrong or that upset you. I want to know these things. How else will I find out I goofed if someone doesn’t point it out to me?! While I may not always agree with your point of view, I am commited to hearing you out and disscussing it.

From me to you
You can find out more about how I try to give feedback and why here.

If I don’t provide you feedback this way - or the way I’m doing it isn’t helpful to you - please call me out on it. (See Above)
